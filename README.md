# Getting Started with Python

## Basic Python Data Types

- Numbers
    - Note that, unlike bash, Python can handle _both_ integers and floating point (decimal) numbers.
    - Integers - `myInt = 10`
    - Floating point numbers (decimals) - `myFloat = 3.21312`
    - If running Python interactively, variable values can be seen just by typing the name of the variable - `myFloat`.
    - If running Python in a script, variable values can be printed by using the `print()` funtion - `print(myFloat)`.
    - Define myInt and myFloat as above. Now calculate `myInt / myFloat`. What type of number is the result?
    - Now try `float(myInt)` and `int(myFloat)`. What are the results? Look back at the values of `myInt` and `myFloat`. Have they changed?
    - Changing numbers from one type to another is one form of "type casting".

- Strings - `myStr = "This is a string."`
    - Strings can be of any length, but are always defined with quotes.
    - Individual characters, or subsets of characters, can be accessed using square brackets - []
      - String indices (and all indices in Python) start at 0
      - `myStr = "biology"`
      - `myStr[0]`
      - A range of indices can be defined with a colon
      - `myStr[2:5]`
    - Strings can be concatenated together with the `+` operator.
      - `myStr = "biology"`
      - `newString = myStr + "_is_super_interesting"`
      - `newString`

- Booleans - `True` or `False`
    - These variables can take the values `True` or `False` only.
      - `myBool = True`
    - These are the data types used in things like `if...else` statements and `while` loops.
    - Logical statements, like `myNum > 3` or `myStr == "test"`, return a boolean variable indicating the result of the comparison
    - In Python, the value of a Boolean can be reversed by preceding it with `not`.
